         <p id="resumefont">This is a one versus one simulator that can only be played by two people.</p>
         <lr></lr>
          <p id="resumefont">It is Bowser vs. Mario, which is a common theme in the Mario games.</p>
          <lr></lr>
          <p id="resumefont">The scoring system consists of lives, when one player runs out of 
          lives, they lose. the randomness in the game occurs with the airplane in the background. 
          The airplane is randomly spawned, and when a player touches the plane, they gain a life. 
          The game becomes harder when the other player receives extra lives, giving them an advantage.</p>
